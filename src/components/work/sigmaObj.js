                    <p>sigma-aldrich (now known as Millipore-sigma) is a large pharmaceutical supply company with products ranging from glassware to cmo manufacturing. the natick site of sigma-adrich focused on bioactive small molecule synthesis, creating products for drug discovery companies. </p>
                    <p>as a chemistry co-op i got to practice my organic chemistry skills by synthesizing, purifying, and analyzing small molecules. as I became more comfortable with my skills, i was able to help in developing new products by doing route design, sourcing pre-cursors, and writing procedures for other chemists to follow. </p>
                    <p>over the course of my co-op I was able to produce 25 different small molecules using a variety of reactions. 5 of these molecules were new molecules which i had done route selection for. all of these products are now available on sigmaâ€™s website for purchase </p>
