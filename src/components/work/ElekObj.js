                    <p>elektrofi is drug delivery biotech startup focused on turning aqueous mABs into high concentration microparticle suspensions. since joining elektrofi in 2019, iâ€™ve worked on the process development and the process development teams working to improve the suspensions properties while scaling up manufacturing to produce material for larger and larger translational studies.     </p>
                    <p>drug product development means creating the best possible formulation for drug dosage. i have spent time learning protein formulations, suspension formulations, surface chemistry, and colloidal science to help create an easy to deliver product.</p>
                    <p>process development means creating the best possible process for manufacturing our product. i got to focus on unit operation design and optimization to scale up a small lab bench setup into an efficient and robust pilot scale process. i also focused on controls engineering working on hardware to collect important process parameters and wrote software to monitor and control the system. </p>
